    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the Dough</li></strong>
            In a bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let sit for 5–10 minutes until foamy.
            Add flour, salt, and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms.
            Knead on a floured surface for 7–10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
            Place dough in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size.
        <li><strong>Prepare the Sauce</li></strong>
            Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Sauté garlic until fragrant.
            Add crushed tomatoes, oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 10–15 minutes. Set aside to cool.
        <li><strong>Assemble the Pizza</li></strong>
            Preheat oven to 475°F (245°C). Place a pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven to heat.
            Punch down the dough and divide into two balls (for thinner crusts). Roll out on a floured surface.
            Transfer to parchment paper or a pizza peel. Spread sauce over dough, then add cheese and toppings.
            Brush edges with olive oil.
        <li><strong>Bake</li></strong>
            Carefully place pizza on the hot stone or baking sheet.
            Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.
        <li><strong>Serve</li></strong>
            Let cool for a few minutes before slicing. Garnish with fresh basil if desired. Enjoy!
